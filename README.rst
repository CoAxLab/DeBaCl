DEnsity-BAsed CLustering
========================

DeBaCl is a Python library for estimation of density level set trees and
nonparametric density-based clustering. Level set trees are based on the
statistically-principled definition of clusters as modes of a probability
density function. They are particularly useful for analyzing structure in
complex datasets that exhibit multi-scale clustering behavior. DeBaCl is
intended to promote the practical use of level set trees through improvements in
computational efficiency, flexible algorithms, and an emphasis on modularity and
user customizability.

The `tutorial for DeBaCl <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/CoAxLa
b/DeBaCl/develop/docs/debacl_tutorial.ipynb>`_ is an IPython Notebook. It is
viewable on nbviewer, or as a PDF at docs/debacl_tutorial.pdf.

The PDF user manual contains documentation for each function. It can be found at
docs/debacl_manual.pdf. A paper describing the statistical background of level
set trees and level set tree clustering is located in the docs/ folder as well.
